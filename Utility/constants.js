`Welcome to the Serious Labs Discord Server!
The SLI Discord Server aims to replicate the social connections we lost when we changed to a remote studio. The server is purely optional and how you interact with it is purely up to you.
Before you do anything:

STEP 1: Go to the #welcome channel to get detailed help and instructions
STEP 2: Go to the user list on the side and immediately change the user Volume on Rythm, Rythm 2 and Trashy to 50%. You'll thank me later.
STEP 3: Join a Room! Or Not! Here's a rundown:

# denotes a text channel
:loud_sound: denotes a voice channel. Conversations are casual and usually hot-mic'd

#the-wall: for memes, links and funny things.

:loud_sound:Developer Room: where most of the devs hang out. Music plays here in the background using !play [link] in the #music-bot text channel

:loud_sound:Library: chat is disabled, but you can listen to shared music using >play [link] in the #music-bot text channel

BREAKOUT ROOMS are for quick breakout discussions. You can make them private, or add your own!`
